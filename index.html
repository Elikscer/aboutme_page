code from any other source, providing source code to another student, 
or leaving my code on a public web site constitutes cheating.
I acknowledge that  If I am found in violation of this policy this may result
in a zero grade, a permanent record on file and possibly immediate failure of the class.
 
!!!!!!!!!!! Reflection (1-2 paragraphs):  I really enjoyed writing this program, but had trouble with blah blah blah.
