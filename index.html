			<h2>My Personal Interests</h2>
			<p>I thoroughly enjoy video games of many varieties, and very likely spend more time gaming than is healthy.  My favorite games generally fall into the genres of RPG (Role-Playing Game), MOBA (Multiplayer Online Battle Arena), and Strategy/Puzzle.  My favorite RPG is either Skyrim or Cyperpunk 2077, my favorite MOBA is League of Legends, and my favorite puzzle game is Portal 2.  I've been playing a lot of Valorant lately as well, which, as an FPS (First-Person Shooter) is a bit unusual for me... but it's been a lot of fun.  I also play board games with my friends, and card games such as Magic: The Gathering or Flesh & Blood.</p>
			<p>Another interest of mine is art.  I love to doodle and have many sketchbooks full of my art.  I have a drawing tablet that I'm using to try to learn digital illustration, as well.  Most of my drawings are of my favorite League of Legends character, Evelynn.</p>
			<p>Lastly, I love music.  I am not very skilled at any instruments since I no longer practice regularly, but there was a time when I played piano, viola, cello, guitar, and electric bass.  My favorite band is Carbon Leaf, a folk rock group from the East coast.</p>
